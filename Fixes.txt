Outstanding fixes / improvements for the Chipkit and Chipkit mk2 boards
=======================================================================


BUGS
====
copy - when scroll happens reposition cursor
copy - mode7 makes a mess of _£# on screen and in copied text
noice brk XXXX reposition text pointer at XXXX OSARGS?
noice enter AAAA <args> enter noice with PC at A and command set up



MEMC
====
Add special read/write user mode that allows TFM to read from/write to user map until next LIC or implement with blitter?

Interrupts
==========
Send all lines through VIDC
Allow select FIRQ,IRQ,NMI for each. What defaults? Don't forget JIM / hw irq during nRESET, enhance?


SERIAL
======
Use MAX232 instead of other chips? (Just remove pins 1/18 or leave as on mk1 but socket for 16pin?)

DISC
====
Use circuit from Master + 1770

ECONET
======
NETINT into VIDC/MEMC, program to send to IRQ, NMI, FIRQ
take module like master/Arch
station id from cmos?

RTC
===
Verify


Blitter?
=======
Ability of VIDC to access RAM during "dead" cycles - how to connect to MEMC?
Ability to slow up CPU to 1/2 Mhz during blit to free up RAM cycles
Ability VIDC to set RAM R/W and buffer
full load (src), load(mask), rotate (concat), mask, save
different bit depts?
vdu 5?


DAC
===
- audio / parallel? links to feed direct or via SID/external
- other ?

SID
===
- fit as standard, links to redirect DAC/sn76 to here and back to amplifier?


- rotate DIN6!
- Add clean NPGFE? or at least some way of cleaning up?
- check RGB levels spec
- Serial = use 1MHzE for ADS as 2MHzE is now stretched - check wiring and problems with serial board
- reset REQ - check what's what with that, don't go through CPLD but route Break key!
- routing through W1/W2, fix component to exclude routing
- serial board, serial connector pin order is incorrect
- bus-A19 now Vcc (conflicts with tsti3? check on board file)
- bus-A17 now req_nRESET
- testpoints 19 now 8MHz (cpu_clk_x4)
- bus buffers, which items can be write only, make a write only bus?
- 1MHz bus buffers? possible?
- feed RA3 to VIDULA to switch video ram banks for double size modes alternate banks every 8 scanlines
- full mapped mode - 2k pages (see 6809 memory controller)
- legacy mode - MOS, SWROM, mapped with single registers, main memory still in 2k blocks
- video as main blocks 
- write via C000-F000, write-only mode on C000-F000 mapped onto video bank?
- Add global resets to CPLDs
- Add LIC signal into MEMc
- add separate grounds for RGB_A, SND_A, ANALOG_A
- add ADC / joystick port?
- 3v3 supplies for each cpld
- add NMI button where reset hole is
- char rom - add eprom to latched teletext data lines, with pixels out to vidc for attribute modes?
- spectrum style modes? memc addressing and latched data?


CHECKLIST
=========
- check all decoupling routing
- check all gnd routing
- check all 

VHDL
====
- cold reset flag in MEMC
